            <p>First and foremost, it is our purpose for every youth member to build a strong relationship God,
                through the grace of God. In the Book of John 14 verse 6 Jesus answered, “ I am the way and the
                the truth and life, no one comes to the father except through me.” As youth members and believers
                of Christ we must do God’s work and spread the gospel of salvation to our youth. We believe it is
                important to follow God early in our youth to have a successful life. Proverbs 22:6 states,
                “start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not leave it.”</p>
