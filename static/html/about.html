                    <p>Ministerios Profetico Roca de Salvacion was founded on Magnolia Street the city of Fullerton on the the 20th of November 2007.
                        It was led by a man with passion in the belief of God. It was his loyalty and commitment to the gospel
                        that started from his own living room, feeling a sudden desire to fulfill a dream that God had placed in his heart
                        just how God has used many men before. In the book of Genesis, God had called a leader to rise, a champion, with the
                        sole purpose to lead a nation from the hands of Egypt to a new beginning.  For that reason Roca de Salvacion has the same desire to
                         restore a community back to the laws of God. It all starts in Fullerton, spreading the gospel in correctional facilities, our local
                         neighborhood, parks, etc. Roca de Salvacion was built from the ground up but with the grace of God it has gained wisdom and the desire
                         for a higher reach. Starting with only a simple podium and a couple chairs and a small group that consisted of only his wife and kids
                         and another member. Having no experience, no musical instruments, he decided to act and purchase a small cd player, it was
                         the only method of worship, singing along to the music. Soon after he realized that his children needed to learn a musical instrument
                         to to have better worship atmosphere. It was so that they began to prepare themselves for the glory of God. As months passed the
                         ministry began to grow before his eyes, he knocked walls down in order to extend. After a year the ministry had grown in number
                         and no longer fit in the house it was time to relocate. They found a place in anaheim and that is where they spent two years,
                         finding Godâ€™s grace they continue to grow and being led to where the lord has taken them, Glory be to God tomorrow
                         and the years to come, Amen!</p>
