                            <p>My name is Francisco Alfredo Hernandez was born on 1969 San Salvador
                                in the department of Moraz√°n. My dream since childhood was to work
                                for the community by helping children, because there was much need
                                for poverty in my country. Migrate to the United States in 1998,
                                when I enter this country everything changed. I faced many
                                situations not know the place, but my dreams were deep inside my
                                heart and not the way how to proceed. My dreams in 1993 met Mr.
                                At that time he was already married to my wife, Blanca Lidia Vicente
                                Hernandez and already had a child and could not find how to impact or
                                help the community until one day someone told me about Jesucristo.
                                El Lord is the all he could help me to bring a word of encouragement to others.
                                That's how I start to work in a church, the Christian doctrine
                                fundamentally helped me in my life, and for me is very special.
                                I know there are people in need of a change in life and only God can give,
                                because outside of it there is no peace. I am now the pastor of the church,
                                where he worked with a team to help the community and help the government
                                reduce violence resulting studies that touch the human heart. If anyone is
                                interested in knowing more about this ministry feel free to contact us</p>
