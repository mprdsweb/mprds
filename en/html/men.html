                        <p>As leaders in the home, church, and community; it is of great importance to
                            build men who are actively involved to be men of God and be able to be an
                            example for family. There is a need for leaders within our church and community.
                            As believers in Christ, we need to equip people of our body and the future
                            generation to come. </p><p>The men in our ministry accomplish this through many
                            different activities held. Our knights are working on missions projects
                            to help poor families in Honduras to contribute a grain of sand in this world.
                            We have to make a radical change in men so they can be the best in the business,
                            their family, and their home.</p>
